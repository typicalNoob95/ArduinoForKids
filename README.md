 Program #1: ASCII characters as LED
 
![ASCIIAsLEDs](https://github.com/typicalNoob95/ArduinoForKids/assets/146441240/526d9f04-8e61-47c1-b58f-f0ba5aff9cb8)

Each LED represents a bit in the ascii representation of characters. Bit 0 is pin 0 all the way to pin 7.  I used 8 pins, so we could reuse this board for other programs using 8 bits characters.
